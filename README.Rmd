# handler

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of handler is to make my life easier. It contains a series of functions that I generally use. 


`handle_required_args`: check if required arguments of a functions are missing and create a message that lists them


## Installation

You can install the development version of handler like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("c1au6i0/handler")
```
